            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Engliſh Man uſeth to ſpeak, as he writes; and the Engliſh Parliament, to ſpeak as they think: No Security upon Earth can be greater then the Engagement of your Two Houſes of Parliament. <hi>Sed quid verba audiam, dum facta videam?</hi> As a Demonſtration of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, I am commanded to preſent unto Your Majeſty this Bill, whereby they have given You for a preſent Supply, Twelve hundred and fifty thouſand pounds, to be levied in two years; to begin from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> next, by Quarterly Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, added to the former <hi>Royal Aid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the end Your Majeſties Occaſions may be ſupplied with ready Money, before this additional Aid can be raiſed, We have by this Bill prepared an undoubted Security, for all ſuch Perſons as ſhall bring their Money into the Publick Bank of Your Exchequer. As the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do naturally empty themſelves into the Sea, ſo We hope the Veins of Gold and Silver in this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38184:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Great Sir!</hi> When firſt We beſought Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to correct the Inſolencies, and to repair Your Subjects againſt the Rapines of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> We did reaſonably ſuppoſe, That the Juſtice of Your Majeſties Demands, would, at leaſt, have had a fair and ingenious Reception: But the <hi>Dutch</hi> reſolved, with <hi>Machiavil,</hi> to keep by Force what they had got by Wrong, and to return their Anſwer by the Thundring voice of their Canon. The Great GOD of Hoſts, to whom Vengeance belongs, hath eminently appeared in Your Majeſties Quarrel, and ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the inſolence of that proud People, whoſe heart is hardened even to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, our ſins do cry aloud, as well as theirs; but God is pleaſed in mercy to correct us himſelf, whilſt by our hands he doth puniſh them, and make them fly before us. I hope this mercy will invite us to a National Repentance: And if God be with us, who then can be againſt us?</p>
            <p>We cannot but take notice of the Sordid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fugitives, who have trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly joyned wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> both in their Counſels and Actions, againſt your Majeſty, and this their native Countrey: We therefore have prepared a Bill, whereby they are injoyned to

               <!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->return by a day, and anſwer to the Law, or elſe they ſhall be attainted, and be ſubject to the Paines and Penalties of Condemned Traitours.</p>
            <p>It hath been an old obſervation, that Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Livings make Scandalous Miniſters; and this moſt frequently fals out in Cities and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate Towns, where are little or no praedial Tythes, and therefore the Preachers for meer want are forced to chaunt ſuch tunes as may beſt pleaſe the Rich men in their Pariſhes: For prevention of this for the future, there is a Bill prepared for the uniting of ſmall Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Chappels in Cities and Towns Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, by the conſent of the Patron, reſerving all other Parochial rites diſtinct as they were before.</p>
            <p>This being a time wherein Your Majeſty needs great Supplies, We held it our duty to eaſe the People in ſome unneceſſary Expences; and therefore we have prepared a Bill for the more effectual proceeding upon Diſtreſſes and Avowryes for Rents; another to avoid Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of Actions; and a third, to leſſen the charge of neceſſary Suits in Law.
